# README for Notification Email Template

## Overview
This email template is designed for IT helpdesk support services to notify requestors about updates to their support tickets. It uses a responsive design to ensure compatibility across various devices and email clients. The template incorporates best practices for accessibility, readability, and branding consistency.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the email is viewable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Customizable Branding**: Uses Ensign College's colors and fonts to maintain a professional and branded appearance.
- **Dynamic Content**: Includes placeholders for dynamically injected content (e.g., ticket details, comments, and user names).
- **Accessible Formatting**: Provides a clean and readable layout with high contrast and semantic HTML.

## File Structure
- **HTML Structure**: Organized into clear sections for the notification banner, header, main content, and footer.
- **CSS**: Inline styles are used to ensure consistent rendering across email clients. Media queries are included for responsive behavior.
- **Dynamic Placeholders**: Variables like `{{RequestorFirstName}}`, `{{ID}}`, and `{{Title}}` allow for dynamic content injection by the server or email platform.

## Placeholder Variables

## Styling and Layout Details
